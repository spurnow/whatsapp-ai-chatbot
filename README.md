# WhatsApp AI Chatbot via Business API

This is an example that uses the WhatsApp Business API & OpenAI's ChatGPT API to create a simple chatbot. To understand how I made it and its working please refer to [my article here.](https://dev.to/rohanrajpal/whatsapp-ai-chatbot-lets-build-one-with-the-api-3pf7)

## Introduction

Hey, I'm Rohan, founder of Spur, an Instagram API & WhatsApp automation software. I recently came across [this OpenAI forum](https://community.openai.com/t/chatbot-with-openai-api-and-whatsapp/480118) post where folks were struggling to create a simple WhatsApp AI bot, so thought of sharing something with the community. Hope you learn something out of this!
